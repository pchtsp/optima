# Python

Here all the code related to python technology will be included.

For example:

* models done in `pulp`.
* data wrangling scripts done with `pandas`.
* applications done with `flask`.

We're using python 3.5.
We're using a virtual environment for python. That's why we have a requirements file.

Code is organized as follows:

* **scripts**: python scripts done for data wrangling.
* **models**: pulp models or heuristics.
* **package**: flask or other application based on python.
