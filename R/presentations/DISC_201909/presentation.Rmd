## Decision problem

---

### Problem (informally)

Assign both **missions** and **maintenance operations** to a fleet of aircraft in order to maximize availability and minimize costs. **Missions** have fixed start and end times and have particular needs in terms of aircraft and flight hours. **Maintenances operations** have specific rules that govern their frequency and capacity.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics('./../../../img/calendar3.png')

```
]
---

### Problem (pseudo formally)

* A series of $j \in \mathcal{J}$ missions are planned along a horizon divided into $t \in \mathcal{T}$ periods. Since all missions are already scheduled, we know time periods $T_j \subset \mathcal{T}$ in which they will be realized. 
* Each mission requires a certain number $r_{j}$ of resources $i \in \mathcal{I}$ which it employs for a time duration defined by $h_j$ in each period.
* Resources (heterogeneous) require recurrent preventive maintenance operations since the realization of missions diminish their remaining usage time. There are also min (max) distances between maintenances.
* A maintenance operation takes exactly $m$ periods and cannot be interrupted. It restores the resource's remaining usage time to exactly $H$ units. There is a limited capacity for maintenances.

--

* **Other**: soft constraints on the state of the fleet at each period and at the end, minimum assignments on missions, initial conditions, default consumption.

---

### Variables (subset)

* $a_{ijtt'}$ : has value one if aircraft $i$ starts an assignment to mission $j$ at the beginning of period $t$ and finishes at the end of period $t'$, zero otherwise.  
* $m_{ip}$ : has value one if aircraft $i$ uses pattern $p$, zero otherwise.
  * each pattern $p$ has a single feasible combination of maintenance starts for an aircraft during the whole planning (usually only two checks per aircraft).

## Prediction problem

### Distance between maintenances

.pull-left[
* The distance between maintenance has a maximum of 60 periods.
* Depending on the amount of missions to do in a planning horizon, this can be shorter.
* The more room we leave as possible distance between maintenances, the more patterns and, as a result, maintenance variables we have.

### Forecasting + Optim

**We want to**:

1. Train a statistical model to predict the mean distance between maintenances for any given instance.
2. Use this information to limit the possible combinations of patterns to assign.

--

**Benefits**:

1. **Performance**: a smaller model is easier to solve.
2. **User feedback**: direct feedback about the solution without needing to solve any model.
3. **More stable solutions**: Every aircraft flies an amount that is closest to the mean of the fleet.

--

**The better we're able to predict the optimal distance between maintenances for the whole fleet, the less optimality we will lose**

---

### Implementation

* Done in python with scikit learn and statsmodels.
* Trained with 5000 small instances solved for an hour with CPLEX.
  * a 70/30 split was done in training/test.
  * solutions far from optimum were not used.
* Validated (semi) visually (not sure the good performance metric for predicting upper bounds).

--

I tested the following techniques:

* Linear regressions.
* Decision Tree regressions.
* Neural networks regressions.
* **Gradient Boosting regressions**.
* **Quantile regressions**.

--

The only two with support for quantile regression (i.e. bounds at quantiles 10% and 90%) were the last two. And the last one had the additional benefit of returning regression coefficients. So I chose that one.

---

### Model

.pull-left[
* **Technique**: *Quantile regressions* to estimate upper and lower bounds.
* **Input features**: 
  * mean flight demand per period (up to power 4), 
  * total remaining flight hours at start (init), 
  * variance of flight demand, 
  * demand of special missions, 
  * number of period where flight demand is cut in two.
* **Output features**: *mean distance between maintenances*.

## Current results

---

### Experiments

* Number of instances: small (5000), medium (1000) and large (1000).
* Time limit at 3600 seconds.
* We seeded instance generation for better comparison.
* CPLEX running 1 thread.

Large instances have:

* 45 aircraft
* 90 months
* +20 missions (3 active missions at any given time).

---

### How good is it (performance)

Better solutions, more solutions.

.pull-left[
For instances were an integer solution was found: 

* in ~85% of instances we outperformed base model.
* ~105% average gain in objective function.
* ~18% less time in average to solve.

Many improvements in feasible solutions:

|indicator         | base| cuts| %|
|:-----------------|----:|----:|--------:|
|Infeasible        |   55|   71|    29.09|
|IntegerFeasible   |  183|  469|   156.28|
|IntegerInfeasible |  665|  291|   -56.24|

|total_instances   |  995|  997|     0.20|
]
---

### How good is it (optimality)

For instances were an optimal solution was found (optimum degradation):
* 95% of instances had less than 4% gap with real optimal.

## Some questions

I want to be able to match assignment patterns (e.g. maintenances schedules) and unstructured input data in order to generalize a decomposition approach.

For that I need to know:

(from least ambitious to most ambitious):

* How do I train the other methods to predict bounds when they only measure mean squares (or some other function that returns the 'expected')?
* Is it possible to match input data to distance between maintenances without the need to manually generate the input features?
  * Assuming the amount of input data can, of course, change depending on the instance. I'm thinking in image recognition where images are all different size.
  * If so, how do I transform my input in such a way that can be read by some ML technique without having to obtain features? (e.g. do I need to create an image of it?)
* Is it possible to match input data to a set of patterns so that I don't even need to even tell the prediction model what characteristic of the patterns I want.
