### Military aircraft operations

.pull-left[

* Mirage 2000 fleet.
* Fleets of 60-80 aircraft.
* A single workshop to do the maintenance operations.
* Check type D (overhaul maintenances): 
  * every 5 years or 1000 flight hours and 
  * takes 4-6 months.
* Planning horizons of 90 periods (= 7.5 years).
* Missions require:
  * aircraft.
  * monthly flight hours.

]

### Problem

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('calendar3.png')
```

A good solution:

* complies with all regulatory rules and mission demands.
* uses the least possible number of maintenances.
* keeps the fleet in a "good state" at every period.

---

### State of the art

* FMP: Flight and Maintenance Planning problem.
* In `r Citep(myBib, "Cho2011")`, US Army aircraft were assigned daily operations over a year to aircraft in order to minimize the maximum number of maintenances.
* In `r Citep(myBib, "Kozanidis2008")`, Greek aircraft had monthly assignments of maintenances and flight hours in order to maximize the availability and final state of squadrons.
* In `r Citep(myBib, "Verhoeff2015")`, monthly assignments were done and several objectives were taken into account: availability, serviceability and final state.
* In `r Citep(myBib, "Seif2018")`, a generalization for different types of maintenances and capacities was done.

### "Classical" solving techniques

$a_{ijt_1t_2}$: mission $j$ is assigned to aircraft $i$ between $t_1$ and $t_2$.  
$m_{ip}$: aircraft $i$ has a maintenance pattern $p$.

\begin{align}
  & \text{Min}\;
  \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}, p \in \mathcal{P}} m_{ip} \times W_p \\
  & \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}, p \in \mathcal{P}_{t}} m_{ip} \leq C^{max} 
          & t \in \mathcal{T} \label{eq:capacity1}\\
  & \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_j, (t_1, t_2) \in \mathcal{T}_{jt}} a_{ijt_1t_2} \geq R_j
          & j \in \mathcal{J}, t \in \mathcal{TJ}_j  \label{eq:missionres}\\
\end{align}

### Machine Learning + Optimization

We:

1. Train a statistical model to predict certain characteristics of good (optimal?) solutions for 5000 simulated instances.
2. Use this information to *predict* the characteristics of good solutions on a new instance ($\hat{\mu}_{t'-t}^{lb}$,  $\hat{\mu}_{t'-t}^{ub}$).
3. Apply the prediction to *guide* de solution of said instance.

--

\begin{align}
    & m_{ip} = 0 & p_{t'} - p_t < \hat{\mu}_{t'-t}^{lb} - tol  \\
    & m_{ip} = 0  &  p_{t'} - p_t > \hat{\mu}_{t'-t}^{ub} + tol
\end{align}

---

## Results

* 30% reduction in solution times.
* 40% more stable solutions.
* 3-4% optimality loss.

---

## Further steps

* **Better predictions** with better features, or predicting several characteristics of optimal solutions.
* **Warm-start Column Generation** with a selected subset of potentially good patterns.
* **Automatize prediction** so it can be easily integrated in other problems.
