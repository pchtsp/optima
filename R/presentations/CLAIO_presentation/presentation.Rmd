# Problem

## Problem (informally)

Assign both missions and maintenance operations to a fleet of aircraft in order to maximize availability and minimize costs. Missions have fixed start and end times and have particular needs in terms of aircraft and time.

## Problem (example)


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}

if (show_gantt){
    gantt
} else {
    knitr::include_graphics('../img/calendar.png' %>% paste0(path_to_R_dir, .))
}

```


## Problem

* FMP: Flight and Maintenance Planning problem.
* A series of $j \in \mathcal{J}$ tasks are planned along a horizon divided into $t \in \mathcal{T}$ periods. Since all tasks are already scheduled, we know time periods $T_j \subset \mathcal{T}$ in which they will be realized. 
* Each task requires a certain number $r_{j}$ of resources $i \in \mathcal{I}$ which it employs for a time duration defined by $h_j$ in each period.
* Resources require recurrent preventive maintenance operations since the realization of tasks diminish their remaining usage time.
* A maintenance operation takes exactly $m$ periods and cannot be interrupted. It restores the resource's remaining usage time to exactly $H$ units.

# State of the art

## State of the art (1)

* In @Cho2011, US Army aircraft were assigned daily operations over a year to aircraft in order to minimize the maximum number of maintenances.
* In @Kozanidis2008, Greek aircraft had monthly assignments of maintenances and flight hours in order to maximize the availability and final state of squadrons.
* In @Verhoeff2015, monthly assignments were done and several objectives were taken into account: availability, serviceability and final state.
* In @Chastellux2017, an initial version of the model was done, assigning missions instead of only flight hours.
* In @Seif2018, a generalization was done in order to deal with different types of maintenances and an heterogeneus fleet.

## State of the art (2)

* Asignments to missions are done instead of assignments of flight hours.
* Missions need to be assigned for a minimal duration.
* This model also features several improvements in the MIP modelling that permit greater instance sizes.

## Complexity analysis (1)

Similar to the 'Fixed interval scheduling' problem presented in @Smet2015.

Let $P = {1, ..., n}$ be the set of tasks to be assigned and $E = {1, ..., m}$ the set of employees. Each task $p \in P$ has a duration $u_p$ , a start time $s_p$ and a finish time $f_p$ = $s_p + u_p$ . Each employee $e$ has a set of tasks $P_e \in P$ that he/she can perform. Similarly, for each task $p$, a set $E_p \in E$ exists, which contains all employees that can perform task $p$. Both $T_e$ and $E_p$ are defined based on qualifications, time windows of tasks and availabilities of employees.

## Complexity analysis (2)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}

if (show_gantt){
    htmltools::div(class = "row",
        htmltools::div(task_gantt, class = "col-md-6")
        ,htmltools::div(task_employees, class = "col-md-6")
        )
} else {
    c('../img/tasks-days.png', '../img/task-employees.png') %>% paste0(path_to_R_dir, .) %>% 
    knitr::include_graphics
    # knitr::include_graphics('../img/task-employees.png' %>% paste0(path_to_R_dir, .))
}

```

# Model

## Model: objective function

<div class="incremental">

\begin{align}
    & \text{Min}\; W_1 m_{max} + W_2 u_{max}
\end{align}

\pause

The two components of the objective function: the max number of maintenance and the max number of unavailable aircraft.
\begin{align}
    &\sum_{t' \in \mathcal{T}^{s}_t} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} m_{it'} + N_t \leq m_{max}
    &t \in \mathcal{T} \\
    &\sum_{t' \in \mathcal{T}^{s}_t} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} m_{it'} + N_t + D_t\leq u_{max}
    &t \in \mathcal{T}
\end{align}

</div>

## Model: main constraints

Mission's needs and incompatibility of several tasks or maintenance in the same period.
\begin{align}
&\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_j} a_{jti} = R_j
&j \in \mathcal{J}, t \in \mathcal{T}_j\\
&\sum_{t' \in \mathcal{T}^{s}_t} m_{it'} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}_t \cap \mathcal{O}_i} a_{jti} \leq 1
& t \in \mathcal{T}, i \in \mathcal{I}
\end{align}

# Results

## Experiments

## Sample solution progress

# Current and next steps

## Next steps

* **Add more constraints**: storage of aircraft.
* **Add robustness**: duration of maintenances, new /different missions, unavailable aircraft.
