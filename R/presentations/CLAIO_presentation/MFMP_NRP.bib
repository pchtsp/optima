    abstract = {The primary objective in military aviation is to optimize operational readiness: the capability to perform assigned flight missions. In terms of a flight planning process, operational readiness has three primary components: availability, serviceability and sustainability. Furthermore, it is influenced by aircraft downtime due to preventive maintenance at prescribed flight time interval. In practice, aircraft flight scheduling (including maintenance constraints) tends to be managed manually and on a day-to-day basis, leading to a reactive approach to aircraft flight hour allocation in which problems with respect to availability, serviceability and sustainability can easily develop. Optimization models have been developed to address this issue, but none of them cover the full scope of operational readiness. This work introduces a flight and maintenance planning optimization model that simultaneously addresses the aspects of availability, serviceability and sustainability, leading to a pro-active, efficient and more robust scheduling effort. The proposed model is tested, verified and validated using Royal Netherlands Air Force data and infrastructure related to the CH47D Chinook helicopter fleet.},

    abstract = {Every aircraft, military or civilian, must be grounded for maintenance after it has completed a certain number of flight hours since its last maintenance check. In this paper, we address the problem of deciding which available aircraft should fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft should perform maintenance operations, in a group of aircraft that comprise a combat unit. The objective is to achieve maximum availability of the unit over the planning horizon. We develop a multiobjective optimization model for this problem, and we illustrate its application and solution on a real life instance drawn from the Hellenic Air Force. We also propose two heuristic approaches for solving large scale instances of the problem. We conclude with a discussion that gives insight into the behavior of the model and of the heuristics, based on the analysis of the results obtained.},

However, there is a relatively low level of study on models and complexity in these important problems.

Furthermore, we address complexity issues by identifying polynomial solvable and NP-hard special cases.},

@article{Rahimian2017,
abstract = {The Nurse Rostering Problem can be defined as assigning a series of shift sequences (schedules) to several nurses over a planning horizon according to some limitations and preferences. The inherent benefits of generating higher-quality schedules are a reduction in outsourcing costs and an increase in job satisfaction of employees. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm, which combines Integer Programming and Constraint Programming to efficiently solve the highly-constrained Nurse Rostering Problem. We exploit the strength of IP in obtaining lower-bounds and finding an optimal solution with the capability of CP in finding feasible solutions in a co-operative manner. To improve the performance of the algorithm, and therefore, to obtain high-quality solutions as well as strong lower-bounds for a relatively short time, we apply some innovative ways to extract useful information such as the computational difficulty of instances and constraints to adaptively set the search parameters. We test our algorithm using two different datasets consisting of various problem instances, and report competitive results benchmarked with the state-of-the-art algorithms from the recent literature as well as standard IP and CP solvers, showing that the proposed algorithm is able to solve a wide variety of instances effectively.},

@article{Kohl2004,
abstract = {Airline crew rostering is an important part of airline operations and an interesting problem for the application of operations research. The objective is to assign anonymous crew pairings either to person-alized rosters or to anonymous bidlines which subsequently will be assigned to individual crew members. Compared to the crew pairing problem, crew rostering has received much less attention in the academic literature and the models presented have been rather simplified. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we want to give a more comprehensive description of real-world airline crew rostering problems and the mathematical models used to capture the various constraints and objectives found in the airline industry. As this has not been attempted in previous research, we think it serves a purpose to reveal the complexity of real-world crew rostering to readers without industrial knowledge of the problem. Second, we want to present the solution methods employed in a commercial crew rostering system, in whose development we both have been involved. The Carmen Crew Rostering system is currently in use at several major European airlines including British Airways, KLM, Iberia, Alitalia, and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) as well as at one of the world's largest passenger transportation company Deutsche Bahn (German State Railways). During the development of the Carmen Crew Rostering system, we have gained valuable experience about practi-cal problem solving and we think the system constitutes an interesting case in the application of operations research.},
