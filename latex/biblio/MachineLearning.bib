abstract = {Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) is a fundamental problem in power systems and electricity markets. In practical settings, SCUC is repeatedly solved via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, sometimes multiple times per day, with only minor changes in input data. In this work, we propose a number of machine learning (ML) techniques to effectively extract information from previously solved instances in order to significantly improve the computational performance of MIP solvers when solving similar instances in the future. Based on statistical data, we predict redundant constraints in the formulation, good initial feasible solutions and affine subspaces where the optimal solution is likely to lie, leading to significant reduction in problem size. Computational results on a diverse set of realistic and large-scale instances show that, using the proposed techniques, SCUC can be solved on average 12 times faster than conventional methods, with no negative impact on solution quality.},

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges in the design of real-world decision support systems is coming up with a good combinatorial optimization model. Often enough, accurate predictive models (e.g. simulators) can be devised, but they are too complex or too slow to be employed in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we propose a methodology called Empirical Model Learning (EML) that relies on Machine Learning for obtaining components of a prescriptive model, using data either extracted from a predictive model or harvested from a real system. In a way, EML can be considered as a technique to merge predictive and prescriptive analytics. All models introduce some form of approximation. Citing G.E.P. Box [1] “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some of them are useful”. In EML, models are useful if they provide adequate accuracy, and if they can be effectively exploited by solvers for finding high-quality solutions. We show how to ground EML on a case study of thermal-aware workload dispatching. We use two learning methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees and we show how to encapsulate the learned model in a number of optimization techniques, namely Local Search, Constraint Programming, Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming and SAT Modulo Theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EML approach by comparing our results with those obtained using expert-designed models.},

Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art methodologies involve algorithmic decisions that either require too much computing time or are not mathematically well defined. Thus, machine learning looks like a promising candidate to effectively deal with those decisions. We advocate for pushing further the integration of machine learning and combinatorial optimization and detail methodology to do so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.},

@article{Larsen2018,
abstract = {This paper offers a methodological contribution at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. Namely, we propose a methodology to quickly predict tactical solutions to a given operational problem. In this context, the tactical solution is less detailed than the operational one but it has to be computed in very short time and under imperfect information. The problem is of importance in various applications where tactical and operational planning problems are interrelated and information about the operational problem is revealed over time. This is for instance the case in certain capacity planning and demand management systems. We formulate the problem as a two-stage optimal prediction stochastic program whose solution we predict with a supervised machine learning algorithm. The training data set consists of a large number of deterministic (second stage) problems generated by controlled probabilistic sampling. The labels are computed based on solutions to the deterministic problems (solved independently and offline) employing appropriate aggregation and subselection methods to address uncertainty. Results on our motivating application in load planning for rail transportation show that deep learning algorithms produce highly accurate predictions in very short computing time (milliseconds or less). The prediction accuracy is comparable to solutions computed by sample average approximation of the stochastic program.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a combination of Mathematical Optimization and Machine Learning to estimate the value of optimized solutions. In particular, we investigate if a machine, trained on a large number of optimized solutions, could accurately estimate the value of the optimized solution for new instances. In this paper we will focus on a specific application: the offshore wind farm layout optimization problem. Mixed Integer Programming models and other state-of-the-art optimization techniques, have been developed to solve this problem. Given the complexity of the problem and the big difference in production between optimized/non optimized solutions, it is not trivial to understand the potential value of a new site without running a complete optimization. This could be too time consuming if a lot of sites need to be evaluated, therefore we propose to use Machine Learning to quickly estimate the potential of new sites (i.e., to estimate the optimized production of a site without explicitly running the optimization). To do so, we trained and tested different Machine Learning models on a dataset of 3000+ optimized layouts found by the optimizer. Thanks to the close collaboration with a leading company in the energy sector, our model was trained on real-world data. Our results show that Machine Learning is able to efficiently estimate the value of optimized instances for the offshore wind farm layout problem.},

In this paper, we lay out a broad framework for quantifying approximations by viewing finite- and infinite-dimensional constrained minimization problems as instances of extended real-valued lower semicontinuous functions defined on a general metric space. Since the Attouch-Wets distance between such functions quantifies epi-convergence, we are able to obtain estimates of optimal solutions and optimal values through bounds of that distance. In particular, we show that near-optimal and near-feasible solutions are effectively Lipschitz continuous with modulus one in this distance. Under additional assumptions on the underlying metric space, we construct approximating functions involving only a finite number of parameters that still are close to an arbitrary extended real-valued lower semicontinuous functions.",

Trivially, a feasible solution can be defined as a point x* ∈ P:={\{}x : Ax ≥ b{\}} that is equal to its rounding x̃, where the rounded point x̃ is defined by x̃j := [xj*] if j ∈ I and x̃j := x j* otherwise, and [{\textperiodcentered}] represents scalar rounding to the nearest integer. Replacing "equal" with "as close as possible" relative to a suitable distance function $\Delta$(x*, x̃), suggests the following Feasibility Pump (FP) heuristic for finding a feasible solution of a given MIP. We start from any x* ∈ P, and define its rounding x̃. At each FP iteration we look for a point x* ∈ P that is as close as possible to the current x̃ by solving the problem min {\{}$\Delta$(x, x̃): x ∈ P{\}}. Assuming $\Delta$(x, x̃) is chosen appropriately, this is an easily solvable LP problem. If $\Delta$(x*, x̃) = 0, then x* is a feasible MIP solution and we are done. Otherwise, we replace x̃ by the rounding of x*, and repeat. We report computational results on a set of 83 difficult 0-1 MIPs, using the commercial software ILOG-Cplex 8.1 as a benchmark. The outcome is that FP, in spite of its simple foundation, proves competitive with ILOG-Cplex both in terms of speed and quality of the first solution delivered. Interestingly, ILOG-Cplex could not find any feasible solution at the root node for 19 problems in our test-bed, whereas FP was unsuccessful in just 3 cases. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.}},

It combines variable neighbourhood search with a general-purpose CPLEX MIP solver. We perform systematic hard variable fixing (or diving) following the variable neighbourhood search rules. The variables to be fixed are chosen according to their distance from the corresponding linear relaxation solution values. If there is an improvement, variable neighbourhood descent branching is performed as the local search in the whole solution space. Numerical experiments have proven that exploiting boundary effects in this way considerably improves solution quality. With our approach, we have managed to improve the best known published results for 8 out of 29 instances from a well-known class of very difficult MIP problems. Moreover, computational results show that our method outperforms the CPLEX MIP solver, as well as three other recent most successful MIP solution methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it tackles the problem of inte-grating production and preventive maintenance in a system composed of parallel failure-prone production lines. It is assumed that when a production line fails, a minimal repair is carried out to restore it to an 'as-bad-as-old' status. Preventive maintenance is car-ried out, periodically at the discretion of the decision maker, to restore the production line to an 'as-good-as-new' status. It is also assumed that any maintenance action, performed on a production line in a given period, reduces the available production capacity on the line during that period. The resulting integrated production and maintenance planning problem is modeled as a nonlinear mixed-integer program when each production line implements a cyclic preventive maintenance policy. When noncyclical preventive mainte-nance policies are allowed, the problem is modeled as a linear mixed-integer program. A Lagrangian-based heuristic procedure for the solution of the first planning model is pro-posed and discussed. Computational experiments are carried out to analyze the perfor-mance of the method for different failure rate distributions, and the obtained results are discussed in detail.},
