abstract = {In deterministic sequencing and scheduling problems, jobs are to be processed on machines of limited capacity. We consider an extension of this class of problems, in which the jobs require the use of additional scarce resources during their execution. A classification scheme for resource constraints is proposed and the computational complexity of the extended problem class is investigated in terms of this classification. Models involving parallel machines, unit-time jobs and the maximum completion time criterion are studied in detail; other models are briefly discussed.},

@article{Brucker1999,
abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

abstract = {The defining characteristic of fixed interval scheduling problems is that each job has a finite number of fixed processing intervals. A job can be processed only in one of its intervals on one of the available machines, or is not processed at all. A decision has to be made about a subset of the jobs to be processed and their assignment to the processing intervals such that the intervals on the same machine do not intersect. These problems arise naturally in different real-life operations planning situations, including the assignment of transports to loading/unloading terminals, work planning for personnel, computer wiring, bandwidth allocation of communication channels, printed circuit board manufacturing, gene identification and examining computer memory structures. We present a general formulation of the interval scheduling problem, show its relations to cognate problems in graph theory, and survey existing models, results on computational complexity and solution algorithms.},

abstract = {The Operational Fixed Interval Scheduling Problem (OFISP) is characterized as the problem of scheduling a number of jobs, each with a fixed starting time, a fixed finishing time, a priority index, and a job class. The objective is to find an assignment of jobs to machines with maximal total priority. The problem is complicated by the restrictions that: (i) each machine can handle only one job at a time, (ii) each machine can handle only jobs from a prespecified subset of all possible job classes, and (iii) preemption is not allowed. It follows from the above that OFISP has both the character of a job scheduling problem and the character of an assignment problem. In this paper we discuss the occurrence of the problem in practice, and we present newly developed exact and approximation algorithms for solving OFISP. Finally, some computational results are shown.},

The past twenty years have been an amazingly fruitful period of research in algorithmic graph theory and structured families of graphs. Especially important have been the theory and applications of new intersection graph models such as generalizations of permutation graphs and interval graphs. These have lead to new families of perfect graphs and many algorithmic results. These are surveyed in the new Epilogue chapter in this second edition. New edition of the "Classic" book on the topic.
