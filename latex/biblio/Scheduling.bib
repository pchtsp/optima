@article{Rieck2012,
    abstract = {We consider project scheduling problems subject to general temporal constraints, where the utilization of a set of renewable resources has to be smoothed over a prescribed planning horizon. In particular, we consider the classical resource leveling problem, where the variation in resource utilization during project execution is to be minimized, and the so-called “overload problem”, where costs are incurred if a given resource-utilization threshold is exceeded. For both problems, we present new mixed-integer linear model formulations and domain-reducing preprocessing techniques. In order to strengthen the models, lower and upper bounds for resource requirements at particular points in time, as well as effective cutting planes, are outlined. We use CPLEX 12.1 to solve medium-scale instances, as well as instances of the well-known test set devised by Kolisch et al. (1999). Instances with up to 50 activities and tight project deadlines are solved to optimality for the first time.},

@article{Bandelloni1994,
abstract = {A recurring problem in managing project activities is to minimize the deviation between the resource require-ments and stated desirable levels. This paper presents a new optimizing approach for resource leveling based on non-serial dynamic programming. This approach permits a marked reduction of the complexity of the problem as it checks for only the feasible time subsets which are far less numerous than feasible sequences. The model, which is applied to an activity-on-node network, requires as input the scheduling results provided by the critical path method (CPM). Applications of the model to two opposite cases are also described and the solutions compared with the ones achieved by the Burges and Killebrew heuristic. Computational results indicate that the procedure provides exact solutions for small to medium size problems, requiring only modest computing facilities.},

    abstract = {This paper deals with resource-constrained project scheduling problems with nonregular objective functions where general temporal constraints given by minimum and maximum time lags between activities are prescribed. In particular, resource leveling and net present value problems are studied. We present different heuristic and exact procedures for (approximately) solving those problems. A detailed experimental performance analysis shows that these procedures also solve large problem instances in reasonable computing time.},

@article{Blazewicz1983,
abstract = {In deterministic sequencing and scheduling problems, jobs are to be processed on machines of limited capacity. We consider an extension of this class of problems, in which the jobs require the use of additional scarce resources during their execution. A classification scheme for resource constraints is proposed and the computational complexity of the extended problem class is investigated in terms of this classification. Models involving parallel machines, unit-time jobs and the maximum completion time criterion are studied in detail; other models are briefly discussed.},
