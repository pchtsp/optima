abstract = {Due to its complexity, its challenging features, and its practical relevance, personnel scheduling has been heavily investigated in the last few decades. However, there is a relatively low level of study on models and complexity in these important problems. In this paper, we present mathematical models which cover specific aspects in the personnel scheduling literature. Furthermore, we address complexity issues by identifying polynomial solvable and NP-hard special cases.},

@article{Rahimian2017,
abstract = {The Nurse Rostering Problem can be defined as assigning a series of shift sequences (schedules) to several nurses over a planning horizon according to some limitations and preferences. The inherent benefits of generating higher-quality schedules are a reduction in outsourcing costs and an increase in job satisfaction of employees. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm, which combines Integer Programming and Constraint Programming to efficiently solve the highly-constrained Nurse Rostering Problem. We exploit the strength of IP in obtaining lower-bounds and finding an optimal solution with the capability of CP in finding feasible solutions in a co-operative manner. To improve the performance of the algorithm, and therefore, to obtain high-quality solutions as well as strong lower-bounds for a relatively short time, we apply some innovative ways to extract useful information such as the computational difficulty of instances and constraints to adaptively set the search parameters. We test our algorithm using two different datasets consisting of various problem instances, and report competitive results benchmarked with the state-of-the-art algorithms from the recent literature as well as standard IP and CP solvers, showing that the proposed algorithm is able to solve a wide variety of instances effectively.},

@article{Kohl2004,
abstract = {Airline crew rostering is an important part of airline operations and an interesting problem for the application of operations research. The objective is to assign anonymous crew pairings either to person-alized rosters or to anonymous bidlines which subsequently will be assigned to individual crew members. Compared to the crew pairing problem, crew rostering has received much less attention in the academic literature and the models presented have been rather simplified. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we want to give a more comprehensive description of real-world airline crew rostering problems and the mathematical models used to capture the various constraints and objectives found in the airline industry. As this has not been attempted in previous research, we think it serves a purpose to reveal the complexity of real-world crew rostering to readers without industrial knowledge of the problem. Second, we want to present the solution methods employed in a commercial crew rostering system, in whose development we both have been involved. The Carmen Crew Rostering system is currently in use at several major European airlines including British Airways, KLM, Iberia, Alitalia, and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) as well as at one of the world's largest passenger transportation company Deutsche Bahn (German State Railways). During the development of the Carmen Crew Rostering system, we have gained valuable experience about practi-cal problem solving and we think the system constitutes an interesting case in the application of operations research.},

@incollection{Krishnamoorthy2001,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a group of problems called Personnel Task Scheduling Problems (PTSP). A PTSP is concerned with assigning a set of tasks with fixed start and end time to a heterogeneous workforce. Each person in the workforce works a shift with given start and end times as well as having skills that qualify the person to perform a subset of all the tasks. This type of problem arises in rostering applications. There are several variations depending on the objective and the exact nature of the constraints. The aim of this paper is to describe this class of problems together with some basic properties, to survey previous work in this area, and to introduce some data sets that may serve as a test bed for future developments in this area.},
