    abstract = {The primary objective in military aviation is to optimize operational readiness: the capability to perform assigned flight missions. In terms of a flight planning process, operational readiness has three primary components: availability, serviceability and sustainability. Furthermore, it is influenced by aircraft downtime due to preventive maintenance at prescribed flight time interval. In practice, aircraft flight scheduling (including maintenance constraints) tends to be managed manually and on a day-to-day basis, leading to a reactive approach to aircraft flight hour allocation in which problems with respect to availability, serviceability and sustainability can easily develop. Optimization models have been developed to address this issue, but none of them cover the full scope of operational readiness. This work introduces a flight and maintenance planning optimization model that simultaneously addresses the aspects of availability, serviceability and sustainability, leading to a pro-active, efficient and more robust scheduling effort. The proposed model is tested, verified and validated using Royal Netherlands Air Force data and infrastructure related to the CH47D Chinook helicopter fleet.},

    abstract = {Every aircraft, military or civilian, must be grounded for maintenance after it has completed a certain number of flight hours since its last maintenance check. In this paper, we address the problem of deciding which available aircraft should fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft should perform maintenance operations, in a group of aircraft that comprise a combat unit. The objective is to achieve maximum availability of the unit over the planning horizon. We develop a multiobjective optimization model for this problem, and we illustrate its application and solution on a real life instance drawn from the Hellenic Air Force. We also propose two heuristic approaches for solving large scale instances of the problem. We conclude with a discussion that gives insight into the behavior of the model and of the heuristics, based on the analysis of the results obtained.},
