        abstract = {A specific Flight and Maintenance Planning problem is presented. In this problem, preventive maintenance operations are scheduled for military aircraft along with the assignment of regular missions. The quality of the solutions is measured via a bi-objective function that smooths both maintenance operations and aircraft unavailability among time periods. A real world dataset provided by the French Air Force is used to test an exact optimization approach based on a Mixed Integer Programming model. Mono-objective computations are solved to optimality for medium size instances, allowing to compute exactly the Pareto frontier of the bi-objective optimization problems. The tests show that these two objectives do not lead to the same optimal solution, but very good compromise solutions can be found thanks to the bi-objective optimization.}

It is a variant of the Flight and Maintenance Planning problem where flights are not modeled geographically since a round-trip to the base is assumed for each flight. It also includes different objectives and constraints.}

        keywords = {A Flight and Maintenance Planning problem is considered for military aircraft. A novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model is developed for scheduling maintenance operations along with the assignment of regular, pre-scheduled, missions. This model takes into account the specific requirements of a military environment and its operational goals. On the contrary to previous studies, the developed model is applicable for the management of a heterogenic fleet. Different combinations of objective functions are discussed for multi-objective optimization and the impact of their use is analyzed on a dataset provided by French Army Forces. The complexity of the obtained problem formulations is studied; new procedures are developed in order to decrease the computational time required to construct efficient Pareto-fronts of alternative solutions for real-life sized instances. The results obtained in computational tests show the efficiency of the developed optimization approach.}
