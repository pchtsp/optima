## Scenario data modelling

Values separated by commas imply there is a discrete option between one value and the other. Values separated by dashes imply an integer range between the two values. Unless specified, all values are generated using a uniformly random distribution for continuous values or a random sampling with replacement for integer values.

### Sets

|Parameter | Value | 
|----|----|
|Number of resources\*              | 10, 30, 50, 130, 150, 200|
|Maintenance capacity\*             | 0.3 times number of resources |
|Total number of special tasks\*    | 4, 6, 8                 |
|Total number of regular tasks\*    | 1 per type              |
|Number of periods\*                | 60, 90, 120, 180        |
|Number of types                    | 1 - 7                   |
|Number of standards per type       | 1 - 3                   |

### Maintenances

|Parameter | Value | 
|----|----|
|Time limit in periods    |  40, 60, 80             |
|Flight hours limit       | 800, 1000, 1200         |
|Maintenance duration     | 4, 6, 8                 |

### Tasks

Two types of tasks will be generated. The difference between the two being the nature of the configuration choice.

|Parameter | Special | Regular |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Minimum assignment (periods)   | 2, 3, 6              |    1               |        
|Start (periods)                | 6 - 36               | horizon's start     | 
|Duration (periods)             | 6 - 36               | horizon's duration  | 
|Number of required resources   | 2 - 5                |  0.5, 1, 1.5 times present value  |        
|Number of required hours       | 50, 60, 70, 80       | 23                 |
|Compatibility                  | Total, type+standard | type               |

### Fleet

|Parameter | Value |
|----|----|
|Type                           | choice                     |
|Standard                       | choice                     |
|Initial state (elapsed periods)| 0 - time limit             |
|Initial state (usage hours)    | 0 - flight hours limit     |

\* These values are deterministic, they are fixed in advance for the scenario.

## Instances and experimentation

A scenario will consist on a single configuration of parameters. 
An instance will consist on a randomly generated set of input data based on the configuration for a specific scenario.
50 instances will be created for each scenario.
